### Class Based Components

- extend React.Component

    ```
      class App extends React.Component {
         
         render() {
            return (
                <div> 
                     <h1>classbased component </h1>
                 <div>
            )
         }
      }
    ```
- we can receive the properties in class based components using constructor.
